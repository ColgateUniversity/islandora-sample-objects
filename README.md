# Islandora Sample Objects

This sample set of objects and corresponding metadata has been organized by object types.
You may ingest these objects into any Islandora installation.
These objects are provided both in raw and zipped formats: raw enables you to view the files; the zipped version is typically how you would ingest into Islandora.

Islandora contains Drupal modules called Islandora Solution Packs and they interact with file objects (like this set of samples) in the following manner:

> Solution Packs present a starting point for users with particular types of data, such as books or audio files. A solution pack will allow users to ingest and edit a particular type of content, including derivatives and metadata. A solution pack also provides a default empty collection for users, configured for that type of content. [source](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA/Solution+Packs)
